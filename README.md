How Long Do Botox Results Last?

Botox results typically last between 3 to 6 months, depending on:

Metabolism – Faster metabolism may shorten effectiveness.

Lifestyle factors – Sun exposure, smoking, and stress may affect longevity.

Post-Treatment Care Tips

To achieve the best results, follow these guidelines:

Avoid touching or massaging the treated areas for 24 hours.

Remain upright for at least 4 hours after treatment.

Avoid strenuous exercise for 24 hours.

Refrain from alcohol consumption on the day of treatment.

Apply sunscreen to protect the skin from premature aging.

Botox vs. Dermal Fillers – What’s the Difference?

While Botox relaxes facial muscles to smooth wrinkles, dermal fillers restore lost volume and enhance facial features. Botox is best for treating crow’s feet, forehead lines, and frown lines, whereas fillers are ideal for plumping lips, cheeks, and deep folds.

Duration Comparison

Botox: Lasts 3-6 months.

Dermal Fillers: Last 6-18 months.
